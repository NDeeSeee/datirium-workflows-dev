# Next Phase Analysis & Action Plan

## Current Status Assessment

### ‚úÖ **Major Success Achieved**
- **ATAC LRT Step 2**: Completely fixed and operational
- **Docker v0.0.72**: Successfully deployed with our fixes
- **Production Impact**: Critical workflow restored

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Remaining Challenges**
1. **ATAC Pairwise**: Fix implemented but blocked by data processing issues
2. **DESeq Regressions**: Previously working workflows now failing
3. **Test Data Quality**: Some compatibility issues with peak files

## Strategic Next Steps

### **Phase 1: Investigate DESeq Regressions** üîç
**Priority**: HIGH - These workflows were previously working
**Approach**: 
- Compare current vs previous working versions
- Check for Docker image or environment changes
- Test with known good input data

### **Phase 2: Resolve ATAC Pairwise Data Issues** üîß
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Fix is implemented, just needs proper data
**Approach**:
- Create compatible test peak files
- Fix data processing pipeline
- Verify summary.md generation works

### **Phase 3: Comprehensive Validation** ‚úÖ
**Priority**: HIGH - Ensure production stability
**Approach**:
- Test all workflows with production-quality data
- Validate all output files are generated correctly
- Document final operational status

## Immediate Action Plan

### **Step 1: DESeq Regression Analysis**
- Check what changed between working and failing states
- Test DESeq workflows individually
- Identify root cause of failures

### **Step 2: ATAC Pairwise Data Fix**
- Create proper test peak files
- Test data processing pipeline
- Verify our summary.md fix works with good data

### **Step 3: Production Readiness**
- Ensure all working workflows are stable
- Document operational procedures
- Create maintenance guidelines

## Success Metrics
- **Target**: 6/6 workflows operational
- **Current**: 3/6 workflows operational + 1 major fix
- **Next Goal**: 5/6 workflows operational (realistic target)
